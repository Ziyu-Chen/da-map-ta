# Da-Map-Ta
It is a web app for visualizing geolocation data on a map. Users can upload their geolocation data that contain latitude and longitude of every location and Da-Map-Ta will show their data on Google Maps.
It was created in five days during the Polyglottal week in Code Chrysalis when I was tasked with learning a new programming language and creating an app with that language.
